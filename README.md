# KNN-Algorithm

#Background:

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

The k value in the k-NN algorithm defines how many neighbors will be checked to determine the classification of a specific query point. For example, if k=1, the instance will be assigned to the same class as its single nearest neighbor. Defining k can be a balancing act as different values can lead to overfitting or underfitting. Lower values of k can have high variance, but low bias, and larger values of k may lead to high bias and lower variance. The choice of k will largely depend on the input data as data with more outliers or noise will likely perform better with higher values of k.
